    help
      gpio-fan-rpm measures fan speed (RPM) by counting GPIO edge events.
      It supports both libgpiod v1 and v2 APIs with automatic detection,
      providing compatibility across different OpenWRT versions (23.05+, 24.10+).
      
      Features:
        - Edge-event-based RPM detection using libgpiod
        - Multithreaded measurement for multiple GPIOs in parallel
        - Warm-up phase to avoid initial inaccuracies
        - Watch mode for continuous monitoring
        - JSON, numeric and collectd-compatible output
        - Auto-detection of GPIO chip if not specified
